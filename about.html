            Since COVID-19 hit and forced many festivals to postpone or cancel, we are impressed by all the inventive
            responses in the struggle to adapt and survive in these difficult circumstances. We’re keen to help raise
            awareness of all those who are now exploring ways to replicate the festival experience online or at least
            share some of their films with an audience. It’s very challenging to do so on any scale and at short notice
            but some innovations are emerging, which actually give new audiences the opportunity to check out films that
            would not have been accessible to them before, perhaps premiering in a festival at the other side of the
            world.
